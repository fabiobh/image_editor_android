# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Android image editor application built with Jetpack Compose. The app will allow users to crop, resize, and apply filters to images, with all edited images saved locally and managed through a Room database. The application will follow clean architecture principles using Hilt for dependency injection, ViewModels, StateFlow, UseCases, and Repository patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select and load images into the editor, so that I can begin editing them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a gallery of previously edited images and an option to select new images
2. WHEN the user taps the "Select Image" button THEN the system SHALL open the device's image picker
3. WHEN the user selects an image from the picker THEN the system SHALL load the image into the editor interface
4. IF the selected image is too large THEN the system SHALL automatically resize it to a manageable size while maintaining aspect ratio
5. WHEN an image is loaded THEN the system SHALL display it in the main editing area with editing controls visible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to crop images to focus on specific areas, so that I can remove unwanted parts of the image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the crop tool THEN the system SHALL display a crop overlay with adjustable handles
2. WHEN the user drags the crop handles THEN the system SHALL update the crop area in real-time
3. WHEN the user confirms the crop operation THEN the system SHALL apply the crop and update the displayed image
4. WHEN cropping THEN the system SHALL maintain the original image quality within the cropped area
5. WHEN the user cancels the crop operation THEN the system SHALL restore the image to its previous state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to resize images to different dimensions, so that I can optimize them for different uses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the resize tool THEN the system SHALL display width and height input fields with the current dimensions
2. WHEN the user enters new dimensions THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the resized image
3. WHEN the user enables "maintain aspect ratio" THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust one dimension when the other is changed
4. WHEN the user confirms the resize operation THEN the system SHALL apply the new dimensions to the image
5. WHEN resizing THEN the system SHALL use high-quality scaling algorithms to minimize quality loss

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to apply various filters to my images, so that I can enhance their appearance or create artistic effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the filters tool THEN the system SHALL display a list of available filters with preview thumbnails
2. WHEN the user taps on a filter THEN the system SHALL apply it to the image and show the result immediately
3. WHEN a filter is applied THEN the system SHALL allow the user to adjust the filter intensity with a slider
4. WHEN the user applies multiple filters THEN the system SHALL stack them in the order they were applied
5. WHEN the user wants to remove a filter THEN the system SHALL provide an option to undo individual filter applications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my edited images, so that I can access them later and share them with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the save button THEN the system SHALL save the edited image to a dedicated app folder
2. WHEN an image is saved THEN the system SHALL store metadata about the image in the Room database
3. WHEN saving THEN the system SHALL generate a unique filename to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN an image is saved THEN the system SHALL add it to the app's gallery view
5. WHEN saving fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my previously edited images in a gallery, so that I can easily access and manage them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a grid gallery of all saved edited images
2. WHEN the user taps on a gallery image THEN the system SHALL open it in the editor for further modifications
3. WHEN the user long-presses on a gallery image THEN the system SHALL show options to delete or share the image
4. WHEN images are deleted THEN the system SHALL remove them from both the database and file system
5. WHEN the gallery is empty THEN the system SHALL display a message encouraging the user to create their first edited image

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to use clean architecture with proper dependency injection, so that the code is maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the app THEN the system SHALL use Hilt for dependency injection throughout all layers
2. WHEN structuring the code THEN the system SHALL implement separate layers for presentation, domain, and data
3. WHEN handling UI state THEN the system SHALL use ViewModels with StateFlow for reactive state management
4. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL use UseCases to encapsulate specific operations
5. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL use Repository pattern to abstract data sources

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during image processing THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN the device runs low on memory THEN the system SHALL handle the situation gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and recovery options
4. WHEN the database is corrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover or reinitialize it
5. WHEN network-related operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide offline functionality where possible

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to perform well with large images, so that I can edit high-resolution photos without lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large images THEN the system SHALL use efficient memory management to prevent OutOfMemory errors
2. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL process images in background threads to keep the UI responsive
3. WHEN displaying images THEN the system SHALL use appropriate image loading libraries with caching
4. WHEN multiple operations are queued THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently without blocking the UI
5. WHEN the app is backgrounded during processing THEN the system SHALL handle the lifecycle appropriately
